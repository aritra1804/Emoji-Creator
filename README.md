# **Emoji-Creator**

In this project I classified human facial expressions and map them to emojis.For this I built a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions.Then I mapped those emotions with the corresponding emojis.

For this project, I used the FER2013 dataset.The FER2013 dataset consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images.This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

1. Angry
2. Disgust
3. Achievment
4. Happy
5. Sad
6. Surprised
7. Natural

Lastly, I also added a GUI feature for facial recognition and emoji creation in order to make the project user-friendly.
